# assumptions

# 1 - linear in the parameters (violation)
# residuals vs. fitted plot shows that the red fitted line is not flat/straight

# 2 - correct variables (no violation)
# iv = age, weekly_hrs, race, fam_income (mix of interval-ratio, categorical)
# dv = number of children (interval-ratio)

# 3 - normally distributed errors (violation)
# normal q-q plot shows model is not normally distributed

# 4 - no influential outliers (violation)
# residuals vs. leverages plot shows points passing beyond the threshold (cook's distance)

# 5 - homoscedasticity (violation)
# residuals vs. fitted plot shows a pattern
# scale-location plot shows points are not equally or randomly distributed above 

# 6 - errors are independent (violation)
# residuals vs. fitted plot shows points do not seem randomly scattered
# there appears to be relationship between residuals and weight
# durbin watson test also shows residuals are autocorrelated

durbinWatsonTest(num_children_model) # p-value = 0, alpha = 0.01 > 0 

# 7 - no multicollinearity (slight violation, ok to proceed)
# most vif scores are between 1-4, so there's no multicollinearity for those variables

# model is statistically significant, reject the null
# approximately 18% (r-sq = 0.182) of variation in number of children can be explained by the model
